The overall structure of the crlEEG.gui package is as follows:

+data: Folder with all native gui packge data types. Many of these will be lightweight reproductions of other datatypes found elsewhere in crlEEG, 

+render: Rendering functions for each of the datatypes in +data.

+interface: Interfaces combine renderers with 

+widgets: Useful pieces of code for generating standardized UI interfaces.
