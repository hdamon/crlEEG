% function boxOut = getBoundingBox(gridSpace)
%
% Returns an 8x3 matrix of X-Y-Z coordinates defining in the bounding box
% around a crlEEG.basicobj.gridInSpace object. The behavior of this is
% dependent upon whether the grid is defined as being cell or node
% centered.
%
% For a cell centered grid, the origin is located at the center of the
% first voxel, and thus the bounding box is offset from this point by 0.5
% steps along each of the principal axes.
%
% For a node centered grid, the origin is located in one corner of the
% bounding box, and the bounding box is directly computed from there.
