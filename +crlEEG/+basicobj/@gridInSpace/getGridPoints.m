% Extends the functionality of the cnlGrid method to cnlGridSpace
% objects.  Rather than return coordinates as X-Y-Z indices, this
% returns the X-Y-Z locations in the 3D space defined by
% cnlGridSpace.directions and cnlGridSpace.origin.
%
% Inputs:
%   grid : The cnlGridSpace object to operate on
%   idx  : (optional) List of voxels to return locations for
